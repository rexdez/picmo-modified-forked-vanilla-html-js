# PicMo JS (Vanilla JS Fork)

This is a **fork** of [PicMo](https://github.com/joeattardi/picmo) that has been modified to work seamlessly with **Vanilla JavaScript and HTML** without requiring a Node.js environment.

## üöÄ Features & Modifications

1. **Dark Theme by Default**  
   - Uses custom dark mode colors for a better user experience.
   
2. **Persistent Emoji Picker**  
   - The picker stays open after selecting an emoji, allowing multiple selections without reopening it.
   
3. **No Node.js Environment Required**  
   - Removed the dependency on `process.env.NODE_ENV`, making it more compatible with static HTML/JS deployments.

4. **Picker Position beside the trigger element**  
   - Instead of taking default position to `left-start` it takes position beside/above the trigger element

## üì¶ Installation

You can include the script directly in your HTML file without any build tools.
